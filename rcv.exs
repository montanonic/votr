# So with RCV a problem is that the voters of the candidates that you eliminate
# have the power. If your ideal candidate eliminates what would have been the
# top pick, what if the majority of the people supporting that otherwise top
# pick actually had their second choice be the bad candidate.

# That means that, though your ideal candidate won the first round, and though
# everyone who supports the ideal candidate would want the good candidate to win
# if the ideal didn't, the fact is that the remaining people who supported the
# good candidate felt that the ideal was too extreme and preffered the bad
# canidate. That could mean now that, if their votes go to the bad, that the bad
# now wins over your ideal candidate.

# In this situation the ideal would not have won either way, but because the
# ideal was NOT eliminated first, the vote was decided by the second-choice
# preferences of the eliminated good candidate, and most of those voters are
# centrist fucks. Thus: for those who supported the ideal candidate, their
# better strategy would have been to ensure that their candidate could be
# eliminated, so that their votes would go to the good candidate, instead of the
# good candidates votes going to the bad candidate. This is FUNDMANETALLY
# STRATEGIC rather than preference based now, because you would be UNHAPPY if
# the bad candidate won.

# If we break this down and suppose that people voted exactly as they felt.
# Let's assume every single centrist voter voted for bad 2nd. And assume every
# single ideal voter voted for good 2nd. What if the people who voted bad
# actually had majority 2nd choice for the ideal? If ideal is eliminated, good
# wins. If good is eliminated, bad wins, even though ideal voters never support
# that. And if bad is eliminated, either good or ideal could win. BUT because
# the votes are more split between good and ideal, because all the ideal voters
# would 2nd choice good

# We have to remember what our goal is here. Our goal is for people's actual
# preferences to manifest in who wins. We want to eliminate strategy because it
# is not people's preferences, but detached work that they have to do to REFLECT
# their true preferences. The goal is always for people to be fully empowered to
# choose their preferences with NO STRATEGY.
